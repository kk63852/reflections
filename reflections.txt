How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
one can easily know the background of the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros-depends on the user.so one commit per logical change.
cons-user error. somtimes missing history commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
git is cool.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git diff commit_id1 commit_id2.
